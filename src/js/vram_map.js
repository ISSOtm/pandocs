 * Use of `on<event>` properties is normally discouraged, however they *have to* be used here.
 *
 * For the sake of maintainability and the SVG's file size, the tilemaps are made of nested `<use>`
 * elements. However, those elements have a "closed root", thus the "inside" elements are *not*
 * exposed to anything outside of them.
 *
 * I have tried putting `<script>` blocks inside of the "template" element, but they appear to only
 * run on the template, not within any of its clones.
 * The only remaining thing is the `on*` attributes, which *do* appear to be cloned!
