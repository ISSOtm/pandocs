# History

Pan Docs—also known as `GAMEBOY.TXT` or `GBSPEC.TXT`—is an old document dating back to early 1995 originally written by *Pan of Anthrox*. It has been one of the most important references for Game Boy hackers, emulator and homebrew developers during the last 25 years.

After its release (1995-2008), it received a number of revisions, corrections and updates, maintaining its **TXT format**. This [folder](https://github.com/gbdev/pandocs/tree/master/historical) provides a historical archive of those versions.

In 2008, a **wikified** version (using Martin Korth's 2001 revision as a baseline) has been published. The document was split into different articles and it continued being maintained and updated in that form.

In 2020, after [this RFC](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev/issues/153), we migrated the last updated version to **plain Markdown** and made [github.com/gbdev/pandocs](https://github.com/gbdev/pandocs) the new home of this resource, where it can receive new public discussions and contributions, maintain its legacy and historical relevance, while making use of modern tools and workflows to be visualized and distributed.

We are releasing everything (content, sources, code, figures) under the CC0 license (Public Domain).
